Welcome ðŸ‘‹  

This site documents **Gamache** â€” a lightweight Python toolkit for **GAM-based pseudotime testing and visualization**.  
It is designed to provide a minimal, tradeSeq-style workflow for single-trajectory pseudotime analysis in the Python ecosystem.  

---

## Project Status ðŸš§
**Gamache is under active development.**  
The fitting functionality is not yet reliable, and results (e.g. association testing) should not be considered stable.  
APIs may change without notice, and breaking changes are expected as the project evolves.  

Feedback and issues are very welcome at this stage!
